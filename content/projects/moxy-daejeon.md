Once a historical landmark in old town of Daejeon in the 70s, MOXY Daejeon is revived to showcase the past and the present, drawing fun hunters together at where the fun thing happens.

MOXY Daejeon is inspired by a train station journey, specifically on Daejeon train station which allowed the city to thrive.

We distilled the elements from the surroundings of Daejeon train station for playful experience Â with blue industrial metal structure, railways neon lighting, colored subway tile, scrabble wall tiles, shopfronts, and textures.

Incorporated the column detail from train station signal as a pattern which brings uniqueness and playful thread that connects all space through the end of journey.
