From where she stands, a glistering moment of lights caught her attention from just about a yard away..

Her curiosity got the better of her and finds herself taking small steps towards the object, which is peeking through the bed of sand, and proceeds to retrieve it carefully.

“Wow, is this what I think it is, a treasure chest?” She thinks to herself, feeling her adrenaline gushing, excited to see what is hidden away.

She gently lifts the latch off and opens the lid, revealing a beam of lights, resembling the sparkles of a rainbow and sees a blurry image of a mystical castle from afar...

“Revealing a beam of lights, resembling the sparkles of a rainbow and sees a blurry image of a mystical castle from afar...A dreamscape castle."
