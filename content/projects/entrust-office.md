Situated in the central area of Singapore, Entrust office is an investment office project, inspired by a working-from-home experience while plug-in everywhere in hotel setup. Considering the stressful industry of investment, we created the space to ease their tense mood where employees can feel comfortably and lean back throughout the long day while being able to plug-in their laptop anywhere.

Entering the office, the lounge with colored acrylic partition in brand orange and big bar table placed in diagonal to create space more dynamic and draw attention in with accent terrazzo stone, burgundy colored laminate finish, and pendant lighting to light up the entrance softly.

We distilled the elements from home and hotel such as long window banquette seating, soft colorful sheer curtains, soft arches, plants, and bar table. On early morning, start a day with sipping a nice cup of coffee on window banquette seating and have a passionate conversation on the bar table with a bottle of beer after dinner-while they can plug-in laptops
