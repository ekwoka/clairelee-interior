"All the worldâ€™s a stage and all the men and women merely players."

William Shakespeare

Located on the top floor of the condominium in Orchard, Boulevard residence is a high-end residential project, inspired by a theatrical stage where a diva stands on.

Arriving from a private elevator, client will first enter a foyer greeting her with soft curved lines and elegant surroundings. Elevate the arrival stage with burgundy marble inserts floor and bronze metal wall trim. Soft colors and textured curved walls with a full height mirror in modern classic style is timeless and elegant yet unique with accent color.

Following through a foyer, soft muted color and materials with beautiful scenery of Orchard welcome you home from the hustling day and directs your senses inwards to the personal tranquil sanctuary.
